## Performance: Virtualization with react-window

### What We Did
- Replaced regular list with `react-window`'s `FixedSizeList`
- Only renders visible items (~6-7 at a time)
- Fixed item height: 60px, container: 400px

### Benefits
- Handles thousands of items smoothly
- Constant memory usage
- No lag when scrolling

### Trade-offs
- Items must have same height (60px)
- Slightly more complex than simple lists

## Testing: Simple & Focused

### What We Test
1. Search input renders
2. Items display correctly  
3. Pagination shows when needed

### Approach
- Minimal setup (React Testing Library)
- Mocked data context
- 3 core tests only

### Why This Works
- Tests real behavior, not implementation
- Easy to maintain and extend
- No over-engineering
